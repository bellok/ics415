                    The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human
                    eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply
                    light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm.[1] In terms of
                    frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430â€“770 THz.

                <p>
                    In the 13th century, Roger Bacon theorized that rainbows were produced by a similar process to the
                    passage of light through glass or crystal.

                    In the 17th century, Isaac Newton discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white
                    light, and described the phenomenon in his book <em>Opticks</em>. He was the first to use the word
                    <em>spectrum</em> (Latin for "appearance" or "apparition") in this sense in print in 1671 in describing
                    his experiments in optics. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of sunlight strikes the face
                    of a glass prism at an angle, some is reflected and some of the beam passes into and through the
                    glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of
                    "corpuscles" (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at
                    different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The
                    result is that red light bends (refracted) less sharply than violet as it passes through the
                    prism, creating a spectrum of colors.
